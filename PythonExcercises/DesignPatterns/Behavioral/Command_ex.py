Command - turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments,
delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

When to use:
Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations,
schedule their execution,
or execute them remotely.
